# Contributing to Diagram Design

Thanks for wanting to contribute — this project only gets better with more eyes on it.

Please read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first. All contributions are expected to keep the community welcoming.

## What this project is

Diagram Design is an agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Factory Droid, Pi) that produces editorial-quality diagrams as self-contained HTML files. The repo is documentation-first: `skills/diagram-design/SKILL.md` is the index, each of the 40 visual types has its own reference file, and the extractor scripts in `skills/diagram-design/scripts/` turn draw.io, Mermaid, and Excalidraw sources into a structured IR.

See [README.md](README.md) for the full picture, including the design system and the import/export flows.

---

## Before you start

- **Create an issue first** for anything non-trivial (new type, behavior change, import grammar work). Small fixes and docs can go straight to a PR.
- **Work on a branch** — never commit directly to `main`.
- **Keep the scope tight.** One PR = one concern. Mixing a new diagram type with a docs rewrite makes review slow.
- **Python 3.10+ is required** for the development scripts (CI runs 3.11 and 3.12 across Linux, Windows, and macOS).

---

## Validation gates

Every validation gate below must pass before a PR is ready. They also run automatically as GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

**Do not bump the plugin version in your PR.** The Claude, Codex, and Factory manifest versions are bumped automatically on `main` after each merge by the Auto Version Bump workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-bump.yml`, ADR 0009), so pull requests must leave all three `plugin.json` versions untouched — CI rejects any change to them. This keeps open PRs from conflicting with each other on every merge. If your change warrants more than a patch release, say so in the PR description and the maintainer will apply the `release:minor` or `release:major` label before merging; the label selects the bump size. (`scripts/bump-plugin-version.py` still exists for the workflow and the maintainer — contributors never need to run it.)

The semantic-pattern gate also caps `skills/diagram-design/SKILL.md` at 40,000 bytes so the installed skill remains practical to load. If that gate fails, reduce duplication or move detail into a routed reference; do not remove routing vocabulary from frontmatter.

Keep native plugin and marketplace `description` fields within 500 characters
for Cowork installation compatibility ([#208](https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design/issues/208)).
They must still name every visual type; keep fuller feature details in the skill
frontmatter and Codex `longDescription`. The docs-sync gate checks both length
and routing vocabulary, and the package gate keeps native descriptions aligned.

Run them all at once before pushing:

### If a gate fails

- **`verify-plugin-package.py`:** if it reports a version change, drop the manifest edits from your branch — versions are bumped on `main` after merge, never in a PR. If packaging validation fails, keep all native marketplaces pointed at the repository root and keep the shared skill at `skills/diagram-design/SKILL.md`.
- **`lint-skin.py`:** the failure message names the file, line, and category (`color`, `font-family`, `a11y`, `external-asset`, `pure-black`, `script`). Colors must come from the palette in `skills/diagram-design/references/style-guide.md`; fonts from the allowed list; diagrams must satisfy the accessible SVG contract (see below). The linter also requires the SHA-pinned controller from `template-motion.html` verbatim and rejects remote resources, CSS `@import`, non-fragment CSS `url()`, event handlers, `srcdoc`, executable URLs, and extra scripts.
- **`verify-*.py`:** the extractor's real behavior no longer matches its fixture or the documentation, or the reference/command/prompt wiring drifted. Fix the source of truth — do not widen a test to avoid a failure.
- **`verify-screenshot-freshness.py`:** a canonical minimal-light example or its committed PNG changed without a synchronized catalog refresh. Before the first regeneration, install the renderer with `python3 -m pip install playwright && python3 -m playwright install chromium`. Then run `python3 scripts/render-canonical-screenshots.py`, inspect all 40 renders, and commit the updated PNGs plus `docs/screenshots/manifest.json`.
- **`build-readme-thumbs.py --check`:** a README preview is missing, stale, corrupt, the wrong size, orphaned, or no longer links to its full PNG. Install the pinned renderer with `python3 -m pip install Pillow==12.1.1`, run `python3 scripts/build-readme-thumbs.py`, inspect the preview changes, and commit the WebPs plus `docs/screenshots/thumbs/manifest.json`.
- **`verify-slopegraph.py`:** the two axes disagree about scale or origin, or an endpoint is drawn somewhere other than where its own declared value belongs. Fix the coordinate, never the label — and never move a point to stop two endpoint labels colliding, because crowded labels mean the values really are close.
- **`verify-ridgeline.py`:** a ridge is drawn on its own amplitude, a baseline sits off the stack's pitch or away from its drawn rule, a ridge is sampled on its own x positions, or a printed range is wider than the bins it claims. Fix the geometry or the declaration so they state one thing — never renormalise a single ridge to make it readable, and never move a baseline to buy one ridge headroom.
- **`verify-bubble.py`:** a bubble is drawn off the shared axis scale its peers describe, its radius disagrees with the one area constant (`r = K·√size`), a second bubble wears the accent, an overlapping smaller bubble is painted under a larger one, or a bound label/tick disagrees with the mark it names. Fix the geometry, never the binding — and never nudge a bubble to open up space, because crowded bubbles mean the values really are close.
- **`verify-bump.py`:** a vertex sits off the rank grid the figure itself declares, a snapshot's ranks are not a permutation of 1..N, a segment curves or arrives by a relative command, or an endpoint label is missing a coordinate, drawn inboard of the end it names, or off the gutter its peers share. Fix the geometry or the declaration, never the label — and never nudge a vertex off its row to dodge a label collision, because a rank between two ranks is not a rank.
- **`verify-beeswarm.py`:** a dot is drawn off the shared value scale its peers describe, two dots declaring one value sit at two positions, a pair overprints instead of dodging, a second radius or a second non-focal fill appears, a second dot wears the accent, two dots share a `data-name` (or one is empty), anything positions a mark from CSS (`transform`, `translate`/`rotate`/`scale`, a geometry property, a motion path) by any carrier — attribute, inline `style`, or `<style>` rule, or a bound label/tick disagrees with the mark it names. Fix the geometry, never the binding — and never move a dot along the value axis to open up space, because crowding is data and the dodge is the only honest resolution.
- **`verify-skin-polarity.py`:** a legend key or caption names the ramp's direction by lightness (`darker is larger`) in a file whose ramp composites the other way. `ink` is a role, not a colour — it resolves near-black on light paper and near-white on dark — so one set of opacities runs darker as it strengthens in the light skin and lighter in the dark one. Name the direction by contrast against the paper (`stronger contrast is larger`), which survives the skin swap, and ship the same sentence in every variant; never invert the word for one file. The gate also fails closed on a claim it cannot substantiate — no resolvable paper colour, fewer than three rank-bearing ramp members, or a ramp that is not strictly ordered — and on wording it cannot parse: a tone word within six words of a magnitude word that no supported sentence form binds. Rephrase that as `<tone> <is|means|represents> <magnitude>` (`stronger contrast is larger`), because a claim the gate cannot read is a claim nothing checks.
- **`verify-geometry.py`:** a label mask overlaps a node declared later in the document, so the node fill clips the label at render time. Move the label to a free segment of its connector — keep the 6–10px gap from the stroke required by SKILL.md §6, and do not shrink the mask to sneak under the check.
- **`verify-block-registry.py`:** a Traceable block decomposition diagram (`semantic-patterns.md` § 8) has a duplicate `data-block-id`, a `data-block-parent` that doesn't resolve to another block's id in the same file, a blank `data-block-id`, a missing or blank `data-block-name`, or a cycle in the parent chain. Fix the diagram's attributes — the checker mirrors the source rather than validating semantics, so a passing file is only as correct as the IDs and parents actually authored on it.
- **Icon assets:** you changed `scripts/vendor/icons/` or `scripts/build-icons.py` and the generated files went stale. Rerun `python3 scripts/build-icons.py` and commit the regenerated files.

Do **not** add a file to `scripts/lint-skin-baseline.txt` to get your example through. The baseline exists only for legacy pre-2.0 examples that legitimately predate the current skin, and it still receives a11y checks.

## The accessible SVG contract (a11y)

Every diagram `<svg>` must satisfy the contract enforced by the linter:

1. `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` naming the `<title>` **and** `<desc>`.
2. `<title>` is the **first child** of `<svg>` (before `<defs>`).
3. IDs are prefixed per diagram and variant: `<slug>-title` / `<slug>-desc` — for `example-loop-dark.html` the slug is `loop-dark`, so the IDs are `loop-dark-title` / `loop-dark-desc`. Bare `title`/`desc` IDs and duplicate IDs are rejected.
4. `<title>` is the short subject name (≈ the `<h1>`, ≤ 60 chars); `<desc>` is one sentence describing the *content*, not the geometry.
5. Purely decorative SVGs (`aria-hidden="true"`) are exempt.

The contract lives in `scripts/lint-skin.py` (`lint_accessible_svgs`) and is unit-tested by `scripts/test-lint-a11y.py`. When in doubt, pattern-match an existing example.

---

## Working on examples (diagrams)

Every diagram type ships three variants: minimal light (`example-<type>.html`), minimal dark (`example-<type>-dark.html`), and full editorial (`example-<type>-full.html`).

1. Copy the closest template (`skills/diagram-design/assets/template.html`, `template-dark.html`, or `template-full.html`).
2. Load the matching `references/type-<name>.md` and follow its layout conventions.
3. Replace the eyebrow, h1, and SVG body; replace the `[diagram-slug]` placeholders with your file's slug and keep the `<title>`/`<desc>` slots filled.
4. Run the taste gate in `SKILL.md` §9, then the linter:

```bash
python3 scripts/lint-skin.py skills/diagram-design/assets/example-my-type.html
```

New examples should be added to the gallery (`assets/index.html`) so they stay browsable.

Motion is opt-in. Start from `skills/diagram-design/assets/template-motion.html`, follow `references/animation.md`, and run `python3 scripts/verify-motion.py <file>` plus `python3 scripts/test-verify-motion.py`. A motion file must preserve complete no-JavaScript, reduced-motion, print, screenshot, and export states. Keep the controller byte-for-byte identical to the template; changes require updating the canonical template, example, documentation, and adversarial tests together.

## Design decisions (ADRs)

Settled policies live as short records in `docs/adr/` — one pinned motion controller, semantic patterns never expanding the visual-type taxonomy, the reveal-only autoplay rule, the SKILL.md byte cap with its trigger-rich description requirement, geometric label placement being verified rather than reviewed, and plugin versions being bumped on `main` after merge rather than in PRs. Read the relevant ADR before proposing a change that touches one; when a PR settles a new policy, add an ADR in the same PR.

## Adding a new diagram type

1. Write `skills/diagram-design/references/type-<name>.md` — layout conventions, anti-patterns, and a worked pattern for that type. Mirror an existing reference's structure.
2. Add the row to the selection table in `skills/diagram-design/SKILL.md` §3 **and** the type's name to the frontmatter `description` — `verify-docs-sync.py` fails if the description loses or lacks a type's lexical hook.
3. Add the three example variants (see above) and register them in the gallery (`assets/index.html`) — `verify-docs-sync.py` fails on any shipped example the gallery can't reach.
4. Run the full gate suite — new examples are linted automatically by `--all`.

## Changing the icon set

Icons are generated, never hand-edited:

1. Add or replace the source SVG in `scripts/vendor/icons/<source>/` (`tabler/`, `simple/`, …). Keep license provenance in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` accurate.
2. Regenerate and verify:

```bash
python3 scripts/build-icons.py
git diff --exit-code -- skills/diagram-design/assets/icons.html skills/diagram-design/references/primitive-icons.md
```

## Touching the import paths

- draw.io: `skills/diagram-design/scripts/drawio_extract.py` — must pass `scripts/verify-drawio-import.py`, which drives the extractor against `scripts/fixtures/sample-architecture.drawio` in all four container formats (raw XML, deflate+base64, PNG-embedded, SVG-embedded).
- Mermaid: `skills/diagram-design/scripts/mermaid_extract.py` — must pass `scripts/verify-mermaid-import.py`, which covers every supported grammar, multi-block Markdown, adversarial labels, trust-boundary behavior, resource caps, and named failures.
- Excalidraw: `skills/diagram-design/scripts/excalidraw_extract.py` — must pass `scripts/verify-excalidraw-import.py`, which covers scene parsing, bound labels, groups and frames, adversarial labels, trust-boundary behavior, resource caps, and named failures.

All three scripts treat their input as **untrusted data** — they never render, fetch, or execute source content. Keep it that way. If you add a grammar or a new security boundary, extend the corresponding verifier with a fixture before merging.

Documentation and wiring must stay in sync: the import references, `SKILL.md` §11, the slash commands in `commands/`, and the Pi prompt templates in `prompts/` each describe the same flows. The verifiers check this — keep both sides updated in one PR.

## Documentation

Most of this repo *is* documentation. When behavior changes, update the affected reference files and the README in the same PR. Loose ends here are what the verifiers and reviewers will catch.

---

## Commit and PR conventions

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): summary`, e.g. `fix(import): support current Mermaid syntax`, `ci: verify Mermaid imports`, `docs(onboarding): clarify the URL flow`. Keep summaries short and imperative.

A good PR:

- has a clear title and a description that says *what* changed and *why*;
- mentions how you tested it (which gates you ran);
- keeps generated and source files consistent (extractor + verifier + reference + command in one change);
- is rebased on `main` and green on CI.
