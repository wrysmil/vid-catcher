"""Adversarial tests for verify-treemap.py — both polarities.

Per ADR 0005, a geometric contract in this repo is a checker plus fixtures that
prove it fires when it should and stays quiet when it shouldn't. The mutations
below are the two defects that actually shipped in review: a sliver cell drawn a
third too small, and a label longer than the cell holding it.

Usage: python3 scripts/test-verify-treemap.py
Exit: 0 all pass, 1 a case failed.
